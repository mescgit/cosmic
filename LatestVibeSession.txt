Synopsis of Vibe Coding Session:

Over this session, we've made significant strides in evolving the "Eldritch Hero" game, focusing primarily on Phase 2: Defining Combat Identity & Expanding Content.

    Automatic Ability System (Formerly Ichor Blast):
        We successfully refactored the original hardcoded "Ichor Blast" into a more generic "Automatic Ability System."
        Defined data structures (AutomaticWeaponId, AutomaticWeaponDefinition, AutomaticWeaponLibrary in src/items.rs) to manage different automatic weapons with distinct stats (damage, fire rate, projectile speed, piercing, additional projectiles) and visual properties (sprite, size, color, lifetime).
        The Survivor now equips an AutomaticWeaponId, and the survivor_casting_system in src/survivor.rs dynamically uses the equipped weapon's definition to control projectile spawning and characteristics.
        The projectile spawning logic was generalized from spawn_ichor_blast to spawn_automatic_projectile in the renamed src/automatic_projectiles.rs module.
        We defined three distinct automatic weapon types: "Primordial Ichor Blast," "Eldritch Gatling," and "Void Cannon."
        A debug mechanism (F5/F6 keys) was added in src/game.rs to allow switching between these equipped automatic weapons for testing.
        Survivor stats and UpgradeTypes related to the primary attack were generalized (e.g., ichor_blast_damage_bonus to auto_weapon_damage_bonus, UpgradeType::IchorBlastIntensity to UpgradeType::IncreaseAutoWeaponDamage).

    Integration of Aura/Orbiter Weapons:
        CircleOfWarding and SwarmOfNightmares (from src/weapons.rs) were integrated into the item system by making them grantable/activatable via new Relic items ("Glyph-Etched Wardstone," "Broodmother's Oculus") defined in src/items.rs. This was achieved by adding new ItemEffect variants and updating apply_collected_item_effects_system.

    Active Skill System Enhancements:
        A new defensive active skill, "Ethereal Ward," was conceptualized and implemented.
        This involved adding SkillEffectType::TemporaryShield, defining the skill in src/skills.rs, creating an ActiveShield component, and implementing its activation logic in survivor_skill_input_system and its damage absorption logic in survivor_horror_collision_system (src/survivor.rs) and horror_projectile_collision_system (src/horror.rs).
        An upgrade to grant this new skill was also added.

    Glyph System Development:
        We established that glyphs can modify both Active Skills and Automatic Abilities.
        The AutomaticWeaponDefinition now includes base_glyph_slots, and the Survivor struct has auto_weapon_equipped_glyphs to manage glyphs for the equipped automatic weapon.
        Two new generic glyph types were implemented:
            "Glyph of Focused Intensity" (IncreaseBaseDamage): Affects the base damage of skills and automatic weapons.
            "Glyph of Swift Execution" (IncreaseRate): Affects cooldowns of active skills and the fire rate of automatic weapons.
        The survivor_skill_input_system and survivor_casting_system were updated to apply these glyph effects.
        The debug menu (src/debug_menu.rs) was significantly updated to allow socketing glyphs into both active skill slots and the new automatic weapon glyph slots.

    Bug Fixing & Refinements:
        Throughout the session, we addressed numerous compiler errors (unresolved imports, lifetime issues, mismatched types, non-exhaustive patterns) and warnings (unused imports/variables), ensuring the codebase remained compilable.

Overall, we've substantially advanced the core combat systems, particularly the automatic weapon system, and laid a strong foundation for the glyph system, while also expanding player abilities and items.
