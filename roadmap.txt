Eldritch Hero: Revised Roadmap

Core Pillars (Unchanged):

    Eldritch Horror Theme: All visuals, audio, enemies, items, and abilities will reflect a dark, cosmic horror aesthetic.
    Item-Based Power (Binding of Isaac Inspired): Players will find and collect items that provide significant passive bonuses, trigger unique effects, or grant/alter abilities. Synergies between items and abilities will be key.
    Differentiated Combat System:
        Automatic Abilities (Weapon/Ring System): The primary source of consistent damage output for clearing most enemies, determined by equipped "Weapons" and "Rings." These are passive or automatic once equipped.
        Active Skills (Manual Activation): A limited set of cooldown-based skills (e.g., 4-5 slots activated by 1,2,3,4/RMB) used for more impactful, situational, or burst damage, particularly against tougher foes or bosses.

Phase 1: Thematic Transformation & Core Systems Foundation

    Status: COMPLETE (from a code and systems perspective, art/sound assets pending user provision).
        Thematic reskinning of code elements is done.
        Initial active skill system and item system (passives, on-hit/kill effects) are functional.
        Upgrade system integrates improvements for these.

Phase 2: Defining Combat Identity & Expanding Content

    Goal: Solidify the dual-nature combat system (Automatic Abilities + Active Skills), expand the variety of player choices, and deepen enemy encounters.
    Key Features:
        Automatic Ability System (Weapon/Ring Focus):
            Status: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS / NEARING COMPLETION FOR INITIAL SCOPE
            - Defined "AutomaticWeaponDefinition" and "AutomaticWeaponLibrary" to manage distinct automatic weapons.
            - Implemented 3 distinct automatic weapon types ("Primordial Ichor Blast," "Eldritch Gatling," "Void Cannon") with unique stats and visual properties (sprite, color, size, lifetime).
            - Survivor equips an AutomaticWeaponId, and `survivor_casting_system` uses its stats.
            - Debug mechanism allows switching equipped automatic weapons.
            - Survivor stats and Upgrades related to automatic attacks have been generalized.
            - Projectile spawning generalized to `spawn_automatic_projectile`.
            - Passive aura/orbiter weapons (`CircleOfWarding`, `SwarmOfNightmares`) integrated as item-granted Relic effects.
            Next:
                - Implement in-game acquisition methods for different Automatic Weapons (e.g., drops, level-up choices, shop).
                - Consider if "Rings" should be a separate concept or if all auto-abilities are "Weapons".

        Active Skill System Enhancements:
            Status: GOOD PROGRESS
            - Current Active Skills: Eldritch Bolt, Mind Shatter, Void Lance, Fleeting Agility, Glacial Nova, Psychic Sentry, Ethereal Ward (7 total).
            - "Ethereal Ward" (defensive utility shield) implemented.
            Next:
                - Implement acquisition of Active Skills via item drops (Relics or new "Tome" item type).
                - Consider adding 1 more skill with a distinct mechanic if desired (e.g., a channeled beam).
                - Refine existing skills for balance and impact.

        Glyph System Development (User-Guided):
            Status: IN PROGRESS
            - Decision made: Glyphs can modify both Active Skills and Automatic Abilities.
            - `ActiveSkillInstance` supports glyphs.
            - `AutomaticWeaponDefinition` includes `base_glyph_slots`, and `Survivor` struct tracks `auto_weapon_equipped_glyphs`.
            - Implemented generic glyphs: "Glyph of Focused Intensity" (IncreaseBaseDamage), "Glyph of Swift Execution" (IncreaseRate), "Glyph of Eldritch Expansion" (IncreaseEffectScale).
            - Debug menu updated for socketing glyphs to both Active Skills and Automatic Weapons.
            Next:
                - Develop a basic player-facing UI for viewing collected glyphs and socketing them into Active Skills and the equipped Automatic Weapon. [NEW PRIORITY]
                - Implement acquisition of Glyphs via level-up choices (currently only grantable by debug).
                - Potentially add more diverse glyph effects.

        Deeper Item System & Synergies:
            Status: ONGOING
            - Expanded "Relic" type items; currently ~12 defined (including aura/orbiter activators and "Crystalline Conduit").
            Next:
                - Add 2-4 more Relics with diverse conditional effects or stat combinations to reach the 15-20+ target.
                - Continue to ensure items can synergize with both Automatic Abilities and Active Skills.

        Enhanced Enemy Behaviors & Elites:
            Status: PENDING
            - Refine AI for existing distinct enemy archetypes.
            - Expand elite enemy modifiers for more variety.
            Next: Add 1-2 new elite modifiers or a new common enemy variation.
