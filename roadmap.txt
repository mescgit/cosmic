Eldritch Hero: Revised Roadmap

Core Pillars (Unchanged):

    Eldritch Horror Theme: All visuals, audio, enemies, items, and abilities will reflect a dark, cosmic horror aesthetic.
Item-Based Power (Binding of Isaac Inspired): Players will find and collect items that provide significant passive bonuses, trigger unique effects, or grant/alter abilities.
Synergies between items and abilities will be key.
    Differentiated Combat System:
        Automatic Abilities (Weapon/Ring System): The primary source of consistent damage output for clearing most enemies, determined by equipped "Weapons" and "Rings."
These are passive or automatic once equipped.
        Active Skills (Manual Activation): A limited set of cooldown-based skills (e.g., 4-5 slots activated by 1,2,3,4/RMB) used for more impactful, situational, or burst damage, particularly against tougher foes or bosses.
Phase 1: Thematic Transformation & Core Systems Foundation

    Status: COMPLETE (from a code and systems perspective, art/sound assets pending user provision).
Thematic reskinning of code elements is done.
        Initial active skill system and item system (passives, on-hit/kill effects) are functional.
Upgrade system integrates improvements for these.

Phase 2: Defining Combat Identity & Expanding Content

    Goal: Solidify the dual-nature combat system (Automatic Abilities + Active Skills), expand the variety of player choices, and deepen enemy encounters.
Key Features:
        Automatic Ability System (Weapon/Ring Focus):
            Status: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS / NEARING COMPLETION FOR INITIAL SCOPE
            - Defined "AutomaticWeaponDefinition" and "AutomaticWeaponLibrary" to manage distinct automatic weapons.
- Implemented 3 distinct automatic weapon types ("Primordial Ichor Blast," "Eldritch Gatling," "Void Cannon") with unique stats and visual properties (sprite, color, size, lifetime).
- Survivor equips an AutomaticWeaponId, and `survivor_casting_system` uses its stats.
            - Debug mechanism allows switching equipped automatic weapons.
- Survivor stats and Upgrades related to automatic attacks have been generalized.
            - Projectile spawning generalized to `spawn_automatic_projectile`.
- Passive aura/orbiter weapons (`CircleOfWarding`, `SwarmOfNightmares`) integrated as item-granted Relic effects.
Next:
                - Implement in-game acquisition methods for different Automatic Weapons (e.g., drops, level-up choices, shop).
- Consider if "Rings" should be a separate concept or if all auto-abilities are "Weapons".
Active Skill System Enhancements:
            Status: GOOD PROGRESS
            - Current Active Skills: Eldritch Bolt, Mind Shatter, Void Lance, Fleeting Agility, Glacial Nova, Psychic Sentry, Ethereal Ward (7 total).
- "Ethereal Ward" (defensive utility shield) implemented.
            Next:
                - Implement acquisition of Active Skills via item drops (Relics or new "Tome" item type).
- Consider adding 1 more skill with a distinct mechanic if desired (e.g., a channeled beam).
- Refine existing skills for balance and impact.

        Deeper Item System & Synergies:
            Status: ONGOING
            - Expanded "Relic" type items;
currently ~12 defined (including aura/orbiter activators and "Crystalline Conduit").
            Next:
                - Add 2-4 more Relics with diverse conditional effects or stat combinations to reach the 15-20+ target.
- Continue to ensure items can synergize with both Automatic Abilities and Active Skills.

        Enhanced Enemy Behaviors & Elites:
            Status: PENDING
            - Refine AI for existing distinct enemy archetypes.
- Expand elite enemy modifiers for more variety.
            Next:
                - Add 2-3 new common enemy types with unique mechanics/behaviors.
                - Add 1-2 new elite modifiers.

Phase 3: Content Richness, Polish, and Long-Term Engagement

    Goal: Make the game feel complete with abundant content, better feedback, and high replayability.
Key Features:
        Dedicated Boss Encounters: Design and implement 2-3 unique boss encounters with distinct phases and attack patterns.
        Extensive Content Expansion:
            - Increase the pool of available Active Skills to 10-12.
            - Increase the pool of Automatic Weapons/Abilities to 8-10.
            - Significantly expand the "Relic" item pool to 30-40+.
            - Add more enemy variations and potentially another distinct common enemy type.
            - Expand the pool of available `UpgradeCard`s with new and diverse effects, including more multi-stat upgrades or unique behavioral changes.
        Advanced UI/UX & Visual/Audio Polish:
            - Implement polished player-facing UI for inventory, skill selection, and potentially glyphs (if pursued).
            - Improve visual effects for abilities, impacts, and environmental details.
            - Add more sound effects and thematic background music tracks.
	add jukebox hero as title screen music for evan.
        Meta-Progression (Optional, for Replayability):
            - Consider unlockable characters, starting items, or persistent upgrades between runs.
        Lore & Atmosphere:
            - Introduce flavor text for items, skills, enemies.
            - Enhance environmental storytelling.
        "Cursed" Items/Trade-offs (Optional - Post-Core Game)

Phase 4: Optional / Deferred Features

    Glyph System Development:
        Status: DEFERRED / OPTIONAL
        - Decision made: Glyphs can modify both Active Skills and Automatic Abilities.
        - `ActiveSkillInstance` supports glyphs.
        - `AutomaticWeaponDefinition` includes `base_glyph_slots`, and `Survivor` struct tracks `auto_weapon_equipped_glyphs`.
        - Implemented generic glyphs: "Glyph of Focused Intensity" (IncreaseBaseDamage), "Glyph of Swift Execution" (IncreaseRate), "Glyph of Eldritch Expansion" (IncreaseEffectScale).
        - Debug menu updated for socketing glyphs to both Active Skills and Automatic Weapons.
        Next (If pursued):
            - Fully stabilize and debug any issues related to glyph interaction.
            - Develop a basic player-facing UI for viewing collected glyphs and socketing them into Active Skills and the equipped Automatic Weapon.
            - Implement acquisition of Glyphs via level-up choices or other in-game means.
            - Potentially add more diverse glyph effects.
