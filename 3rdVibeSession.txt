feat: Complete Phase 1 of Eldritch Horror Transformation

This commit includes the foundational changes for Phase 1 of the
Eldritch Horror themed bullet heaven game.

Key Features and Changes:

1.  **Thematic Refactoring:**
    *   Extensive renaming of structs, enums, functions, variables,
        and UI text throughout the codebase to align with an
        Eldritch Horror aesthetic (e.g., Player to Survivor,
        Enemy to Horror, XP to Echoes).
    *   File modules renamed (e.g., `player.rs` to `survivor.rs`).
    *   All asset paths (sprites, audio) updated to point to
        thematic placeholder names (e.g., `survivor_placeholder.png`,
        `cyclopean_ruins_tile_placeholder.png`,
        `ritual_cast_placeholder.ogg`).

2.  **Basic Active Skill System:**
    *   Implemented core data structures for skills (`SkillDefinition`,
        `ActiveSkillInstance`).
    *   Survivor starts with "Eldritch Bolt" (single target projectile).
    *   "Mind Shatter" skill implemented as a multi-projectile short-range
        cone attack.
    *   Input system allows triggering of equipped skills.

3.  **Basic Item System:**
    *   Implemented core data structures for items (`ItemDefinition`,
        `ItemEffect`).
    *   Added several passive stat-boosting items (health, speed,
        damage, etc.) and more complex effect-triggering items.
    *   Horrors can drop items, and Survivors can collect them to
        gain their effects.

4.  **Upgrade System Integration:**
    *   Level-up system now offers choices to:
        *   Improve equipped active skills (damage, cooldown).
        *   Gain re-themed passive stat boosts.
        *   Rarely, acquire new items (relics) or basic skills.
    *   `UpgradePool` updated with thematic and functional upgrades.

5.  **Testing:**
    *   Added basic unit tests for core logic in skills, items,
        and upgrades, located in the `tests/` directory.

This completes the planned work for Phase 1, establishing the
new theme and core gameplay systems for items and active skills.
The next phase will focus on expanding these systems with more
content and features.
